# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **Tomasz CzermiÅ„ski**, a Software Engineer and SRE with a background in **observability, performance tuning, and data-intensive applications**.  

I started my career as a Java programmer, working with the usual stack â€” **Spring, Hibernate, all that enterprise magic**. What really hooked me, though, was when I first opened **JProfiler** and started tuning the JVM. That moment pushed me deeper into **profiling, optimization, and system behavior under load**.  

Since then, Iâ€™ve moved into Go and C, where I focus on building and optimizing systems for **efficiency, reliability, and scale**. My SRE experience also shaped the way I think about **resiliency, monitoring, and operability** â€” not just how fast code runs, but how well it behaves in production.  

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a dad of four and a bit of a **C (and Go) fanboy**. I also like exploring **async programming** and poking around in Rust and Python.  

On this blog, I share what I learn about:
- Performance engineering (profiling, memory optimization, concurrency)  
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, checks scheduling & processing, metrics pipelines)  
- Systems & reliability (Go, C, SRE practices, sometimes Rust)  
- Lessons learned from real-world projects
